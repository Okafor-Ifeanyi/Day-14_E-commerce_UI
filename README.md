Genesys 20 days Coding Challenge

Day 14 - E-commerce UI

Fastest MVP completed yet under 4 hours, I dont pray for my life to get easier but to get better at handling difficult tasks. So tired

My Inspiration here would be God and My ability to persever towards huge work loads

Love you all, let me know what you think //
